Beerduino by Malcolm Morris-Pence, 2011

The goal of this project is to regulate the temperature of a homebrew 
fermentation chamber with an Arduino board. While there are plenty of 
off-the-shelf products that can do this perfectly well, I am mostly 
interested in the chance to learn to use some technolgies that have 
been of interest to me in a way that's useful to me. Eventually I plan 
to have a Rails application that can present everything done here on a 
nice site that I can use to remotely monitor and adjust conditions.

The Arduino will read the sensor data of thermistors either near or in 
the beer and turn power on/off to a cooler or heater according to 
deviance from a target temperature.  The serial port will be used to 
log sensor and state data to an external application if present and to 
take commands from said application. Basic real-time data is printed 
to a 20x4 LCD screen.

At the time of this writing, the hardware configuration is as follows:

2 green, 2 red LEDs (pins 7-10) to indicate temperature variance 
(These are an artifact of initial tinkering. They will be removed as 
this nears completion.)
1 analog thermistor (on A0)

2 digital one-wire temperature sensors DS18B20 (pin 6)

1 20x4 LCD screen:
	Pin 2 – LCD pin 14
	Pin 3 – LCD pin 13
	Pin 4 – LCD pin 12
	Pin 5 – LCD pin 11
	Pin 12 – LCD pin 6 (EN)
	Pin 13 – LCD pin 4 (RS)
	
Planned: Remove at least 2 LEDs for power controls (Mosfet to 5V relay 
to 24V relay to power outlet)

This is very much a work in progress and a chance for me to learn 
about using the Arduino. Any questions, comments, or critiques are 
more than welcome!
